    "Desc": "The band-suspended kettlebell bench press is a bench press variation where kettlebells or weight plates are hung from the ends of a barbell by looped bands. The suspended weights can be in addition to normally loaded weight plates, or in the place of them. Because the instability of the weights makes the lift difficult, this bench press variety is a popular accessory movement for building the traditional bench press in powerlifting training.",

It is usually performed for high reps, such as 10-15 reps per set or more, as part of a shoulder or upper-body workout.",

    "Desc": "The single-arm stiff-legged deadlift is a dumbbell exercise that targets the hamstrings, glutes, lower and upper back, and core. The difference between a stiff-legged deadlift and a Romanian deadlift is primarily the amount of knee bend. The knees are only slightly bent in a stiff-legged deadlift, while they bend more in a Romanian deadlift. Stiff-legged deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight. Feel free to wear a weight belt to protect your lower back.",

    "Desc": "The single-arm half-kneeling shoulder press is a popular exercise to target the deltoid muscles while also developing strength and stability in the core and hips. Balance can be a challenge, which is one reason why this movement is generally trained lighter than standing single-arm shoulder presses. The half-kneeling press can be used as an accessory lift for the shoulder press or bench press, or simply as a technique to make shoulder presses stricter and more athletic.",
